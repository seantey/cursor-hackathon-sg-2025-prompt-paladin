The Citadel of Prompts, home of the Prompt Paladins, the last bastion against developer toxicity and sin. Within its radiant halls, they guard the fragile harmony between human and machine, cleansing corrupted code and calming the storms of misguided prompts. For in the AI realms, a single toxic word can twist intention and fracture clarity.

Thus the Paladins labor endlessly, healing wounded syntax, sanctifying context, and defending the sacred art of clear and purposeful instruction.
